      <h3>What is the Yoyo Dojo?</h3>
      <p>
      The primary purpose of this organization shall be to provide a casual, social atmosphere for Yo-Yoers of all skill levels and yo-yo enthusiasts, as well as a welcoming environment for those who are just learning or interested in learning.  Learning to be dexterous with ones hands as well as gain confidence through performances.  The club will also serve as a forum for seeking out and planning opportunities for community service.  Finally, the organization may plan for performing venues and other events.
      </p>

      <h3>When / Where do we meet?</h3>
      <p>We usually meet on Fridays from 3pm to 6pm.  Feel free to come and leave anytime during that period.  If the weather is nice, we usually meet on Voorhee's mall on College Avenue.  Otherwise, we will meet in the International Lounge, Busch Campus Center.</p>

      <h3>Why should I learn?</h3>
      <p>Ever been stuck in a power outage with no source of entertainment because your phone battery died?  Yoyo's don't need batteries to provide you with hours of fun, and they conveniently fit in your pockets.  Amaze your friends with the latest tricks while building your dexterity!
      </p>

      <h3>But I'll never be able to do these things!</h3>
      <p>Nonsense!  Like with any activity / sport, it takes some practice and time.  Anyone can perform some basic tricks after regular practice.  It is no harder than learning to ride a bike or drive a car.  Don't give up if you don't learn right away!
      </p>

      <h3>How should I start?</h3>
      <p>Come to our meetings!  We will teach you the basics, from proper throwing techniques to performing your first trick!  Don't have a yoyo?
